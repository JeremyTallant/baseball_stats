Judge is one of the physically largest players in Major League Baseball standing 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) tall and weighing 282 pounds (128 kg). He also hit the <a href=\"https://www.mlb.com/news/aaron-judge-sets-statcast-exit-velocity-record/c-235640846\">hardest home run</a> ever recorded. How do we know this? <strong>Statcast</strong>.</p>\n","<p>Statcast is a state-of-the-art tracking system that uses high-resolution cameras and radar equipment to measure the precise location and movement of baseballs and baseball players. Introduced in 2015 to all 30 major league ballparks, Statcast data is revolutionizing the game. Teams are engaging in an \"arms race\" of data analysis, hiring analysts left and right in an attempt to gain an edge over their competition. This <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rOKGKhQe8U\">video</a> describing the system is incredible.</p>\n","<p><strong>In this notebook</strong>, we're going to wrangle, analyze, and visualize Statcast data to compare Mr. Judge and another (extremely large) teammate of his. Let's start by loading the data into our Notebook. There are two CSV files, <code>judge.csv</code> and <code>stanton.csv</code>, both of which contain Statcast data for 2015-2017. We'll use pandas DataFrames to store this data. Let's also load our data visualization libraries, matplotlib and seaborn.</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"4"},"tags":["sample_code"]},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","%matplotlib inline\n","\n","# Load Aaron Judge's Statcast data\n","judge = pd.read_csv('datasets/judge.csv')\n","\n","# Load Giancarlo Stanton's Statcast data\n","stanton = pd.read_csv('datasets/stanton.csv')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"11"},"deletable":false,"editable":false,"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"source":["## 2. What can Statcast measure?\n","<p>The better question might be, what can't Statcast measure?</p>\n","<blockquote>\n","  <p>Starting with the pitcher, Statcast can measure simple data points such as velocity. At the same time, Statcast digs a whole lot deeper, also measuring the release point and spin rate of every pitch.</p>\n","  <p>Moving on to hitters, Statcast is capable of measuring the exit velocity, launch angle and vector of the ball as it comes off the bat. From there, Statcast can also track the hang time and projected distance that a ball travels.</p>\n","</blockquote>\n","<p>Let's inspect the last five rows of the <code>judge</code> DataFrame. You'll see that each row represents one pitch thrown to a batter. You'll also see that some columns have esoteric names. If these don't make sense now, don't worry.

Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton, prolific sluggers\n","<p><img style=\"float: left;margin:5px 20px 5px 1px\" src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_250/img/stanton_wide.jpg\"></p>\n","<p>This is Giancarlo Stanton. He is also a very large human being, standing 6 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 245 pounds. Despite not wearing the same jersey as Judge in the pictures provided, in 2018 they will be teammates on the New York Yankees. They are similar in a lot of ways, one being that they hit a lot of home runs. Stanton and Judge led baseball in home runs in 2017, with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJ6Bz5P6dg4\">59</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw3pFHMM9fk\">52</a>, respectively. These are exceptional totals - the player in third \"only\" had 45 home runs.</p>\n","<p>Stanton and Judge are also different in many ways. One is <a href=\"http://m.mlb.com/glossary/statcast/batted-ball-event\">batted ball events</a>, which is any batted ball that produces a result. This includes outs, hits, and errors. Next, you'll find the counts of batted ball events for each player in 2017.
