# A New Era of Data Analysis in Baseball
## Description 
There's a new era of data analysis in baseball. Using a new technology called Statcast, Major League Baseball is now collecting the precise location and movements of its baseballs and players. In this project, we will use Statcast data to compare the home runs of two of baseball's brightest (and largest) stars, Aaron Judge (6'7") and Giancarlo Stanton (6'6"), both of whom now play for the New York Yankees.

The dataset used in this project is from [Baseball Savant.](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/about)
## Usage
Clone this repository and open the Jupyter notebook file (`*.ipynb`) in a Jupyter environment with Python kernel support. Make sure to install the required packages such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`. You can do this by running the following commands in a code cell within the notebook:
```python
!pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```
Once the packages are installed, run the code cells in the notebook to generate the plots and analyses.

If you don't have a Jupyter environment set up, you can install Jupyter Notebook and the Python kernel using the following steps:

1. Install Jupyter Notebook by following the instructions on the [official Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

2. Ensure you have Python installed. If not, you can download and install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
